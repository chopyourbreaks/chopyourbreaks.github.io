    <h1>chop your breaks</h1>
    <p>sure, that amen break you ripped from reddit sounds cool, but if you're going to call it breakcore, your breaks should be broken. chopped. re-arranged. </br> while you're at it, add some variation and effects- pitch your kicks, roll your snares.</p>
    <p>you could even throw in a gabber kick or two...</p>
    <p>add a sick filter, distort your fills, and mix multiple breaks together. make it unique.</p>
    <p>breakcore as a genre should have chopped breaks.</p>
    <p>why? because that's what the genre is about. you could put an ambient pad, chiptune lead, or screaming in your track, but chopped, modified breaks will make it breakcore. </br>if you don't do that, you don't make breakcore.</p>
